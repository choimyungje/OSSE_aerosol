Hi Rob -

I've checked the new aerosol development by running the UVN tests based on
  the tests:
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Linearized_Master.f90
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Radiances_Master.f90
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Radiances_Master_FD12.f90
under both gfortran and NAG.

I found a few bugs.  In particular, you'll want to look for
  "mick fix"s in the above drivers.  You may wish to remove
  the "mick fix" comments for cleanliness.

I put your recent results under:
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Results_Rob/
  fort_test_files_Rob/

Similarly, mine are under:
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Results_mick_gfortran/
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Results_mick_nag/
  fort_test_files_mick_gfortran/
  fort_test_files_mick_nag/

I generated the diff files for the files in:
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Results_mick_gfortran/
  GEMSTOOL_UVN_Results_mick_nag/
using "gems_check.bash"

I generated the diff files for the files in:
  fort_test_files_mick_gfortran/
  fort_test_files_mick_nag/
using "gems_check_lin_aero.bash"

I don't know if you'll want to keep these subdirectories
  in there when you send the package to the Koreans;
  I just left them in there solely for your reference
