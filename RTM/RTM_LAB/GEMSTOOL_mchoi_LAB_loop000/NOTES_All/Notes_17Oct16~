Transition to Version 2.7 of VLIDORT
====================================

Only the routine GEMSTOOL_RTInitialize.f90 needed some upgrades.
   -- Mostly minor. Look for 10/17/16.

None of the other routines needed changing!

Wrappers. Only the Linearized wrappers needed changing. some variables
in Version 2.6 have been retired and there aer some new variables
in Version 2.7 which need to initialized (and set - see below).

in each case (UVn or NSW) a new makefile is required to compile
the VLIDORT Version 2.7 code.
